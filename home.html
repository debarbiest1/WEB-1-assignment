                <h3>Short info</h3>
                <p>I am Kumissay Zhalmagambetova, a 19-year-old software engineering student at Astana IT University, born on January 20, 2005. Coming from a large family, I have always been motivated to pursue my goals with determination. I completed 12 years of schooling before beginning my journey into higher education.</p>

                <p>My interests lie in research, particularly in areas like globalization, the role of women in IT, and politics. Iâ€™ve presented my research at prestigious conferences such as IEEE, MUN and NIRS. Recently, I faced a major challenge, having undergone a significant surgery just a month ago, but this experience has only strengthened my resolve to succeed.</p>
